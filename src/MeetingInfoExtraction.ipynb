Using some example outputs - **form heuristics** (based on NLP features of the interested input)\n\n3. **Validate the heuristics** -- how well does the heuristic extract necessary items? \n(accordingly repeat this step and the previous till desired results comeup)  \n\n4. Formalize the operations to a single function for **service intergration**"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Evee-Output\n\nCalling out my assumptions of what can be a good response from the NLP service.  \nFrom the transcription, I am considering following information to be of interest for a meeting MoM.\n\n### Content of interest in input\n\n1. **Directly Address Evee** \n  - `Hey Evee, {can you | please  | can you please} add  (task) X to person (Y)`   \n  - *Just a sample. Same sentence can be said in various ways*\n    - `Evee, {can you | please | ... } put (task) X to person (Y)'s list`\n    - `Remember to assign (task) X to (person) Y, Evee`\n   \n  - Above is easier to implement as we can narrow down to those part of transcripts where Evee is adressed\n  \n\n\n2. **Actionable or Commitable Item phrases** \n  - Dialogues with possible action items  \n     `I have been doing this but will update you with other alternatives`\n  - **Note:-** Action items can be part of a previous reference\n      ```\n      05:10 --> 05:12 : I was looking into (task) X and I did action A.\n      05:13 --> 05:16 : True (person name) Y, but I feel we should also try other (action) B. Can (you| person Y) do it?\n      05:16 --> 05:17 : Sure\n      ```\n  - Once the actions are identified, map with the person's involved\n    - Involved person may be already mentioned in the tasks\n    - Check for phrases of `I|You` etc.\n    \n**Note: I will assume there can be false positives of tasks generated although it wasn't decided to go ahead with it..**  \n**Overall, more tasks generated is better than less tasks**  \n  \n**Also, assumption is if the ownership of a task changes we can add both previous and the new user and let it be modifiable through actionable cards**\n\n    \n\n### Service Output\n\n```\n## list of todos\nresults = [{actionEntity  , intent , peopleEntity, MoMString}, ....]\n```\nwhere  \n**actionEntity** = token(s)  describing the tasks  \n  \n**intent** = verb - Design/Develop etc.  \n  \n**peopleEntity** = names list of persons involved  \n  \n**MoMString** = generated from above three to be directly used in adaptive card  \n"},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Data assemble"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"## Taking very simple static strings as text for now - \n## In hack, we need a vtt file parser to extract text from therein\n## For example, \n\n\"\"\"\n0:0:0.0 --> 0:0:5.290\n<v 1ae37f18-c4fb-454a-8514-ad5b764b92f1@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, I think please don't read the transcript because this transcripts for my English especially is very bad so.</v>\n\n0:0:9.250 --> 0:0:11.520\n<v 1ae37f18-c4fb-454a-8514-ad5b764b92f1@72f988bf-86f1-41af-91ab-2d7cd011db47>Yeah, I think so.
