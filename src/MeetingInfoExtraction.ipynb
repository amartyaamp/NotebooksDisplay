Same sentence can be said in various ways*\n    - `Evee, {can you | please | ... } put (task) X to person (Y)'s list`\n    - `Remember to assign (task) X to (person) Y, Evee`\n   \n  - Above is easier to implement as we can narrow down to those part of transcripts where Evee is adressed\n  \n\n\n2. **Actionable or Commitable Item phrases** \n  - Dialogues with possible action items  \n     `I have been doing this but will update you with other alternatives`\n  - **Note:-** Action items can be part of a previous reference\n      ```\n      05:10 --> 05:12 : I was looking into (task) X and I did action A.\n      05:13 --> 05:16 : True (person name) Y, but I feel we should also try other (action) B.
